## This talk

- Who are we?
- What is a humane team?
- How can we improve?

Note:



## Who are we?
![Sliding Scale: collocated to distributed](/images/sliding-scale.svg "Sliding Scale")

Note: Transition to next slide: the genesis for this talk was looking at how we've broken our teams


## Team Death Spiral

Note:
Dan - point out link between 5 Dysfunctions of a Team & Project Aristotle. Transition to next slide: so how do you climb out of this death spiral?



## We broke the team
* Collocated â†’ dispersed
* Communicating presence
* (Remote) pairing
* Supporting new hires

Note: Dan - Shift from entirely co-located, to partly remote PM, to ad-hoc remoteness
We've had some difficult experiences when we've injected randomness into our locations. We were ill prepared for this.



## [ collocated | distributed ]
## is inhumane

Note: initially we both thought the other was "inhumane". Blocks of uninterrupted time vs. the intensity of pairing.


## "Humane" is subjective
![Humane to Inhumane](/images/humane-inhumane.svg "Team characteristics on a sliding scale")

Note: the characteristics of a humane team aren't the same for all teams; it will be based on what you value within a team. Emma and Dan both think there are things about the other's "type" of team that's inhumane. Start to compare collocated vs. distributed.



## Use an evaluation framework:
## the team member lifecycle

Note: Emma to discuss: Using the framework of an employee's "lifecycle" we can start to compare the merits of collocated vs. distributed teams.

# Characteristics of Humane Teams

Note: regardless of whether you are collocated, distributed or blended, these are our top lessons from having shared our experiences / stories.



## Prepare for the schedule you are planning to work

Note: Make it obvious how to communicate immediately in any context. Hardware, AV, Logistics, Room bookings.



## Make work achievable
### (Dopamine!)
![Dopamine](/images/dopamine.png "Dopamine")

Note: Dan - story on breaking down stories; using our natural reward system to help humans



## If it works, write it down
And don't be afraid to change what you've written.

Note:
Dan - story about how introspective git repo has helped.

Emma - documentation enforces consistency, and makes it clearer when processes need to change



## Work from shared values

Note: regardless of practices, having a set of team values allows you to anchor the things you believe in. Practices will change depending on context, but values don't


## XP Values
![Death Spiral Antidote](/images/xp-values.svg "XP Values counteract the death spiral")

Note: Dan - explain that these values appear to be an antidote to the death spiral



## Agile Manifesto

## Summary

Collocated, distributed, and blended teams *can* all work well...if you:

   * start with shared values.
   * make work achievable.
   * prepare for your next context.
   * codify what works.
