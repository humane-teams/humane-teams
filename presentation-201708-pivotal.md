## What is a humane team?

What do we even mean?

Why does it matter?

Note:



"I had begun to notice that the more *humanely* I treated myself and others, the more *productive* we all became"

Kent Beck, XP Explained



## Humane
### (Productive & Effective)
* Kindness & Respect
* Safe to be wrong
* Authentic conversations
* Meeting people’s needs



## Inhumane
### (Unproductive & Ineffective)
* Too busy to improve
* When you "pick your battles"
* Heroics
* Practices without Values



## Team member lifecycle

### Joining → Working → Leaving



# Joining Teams

## We broke the team
* Shifting from collocated → dispersed
* Part-time members
* Communicating presence
* Remote pairing
* Supporting new hires
* AV/meeting room nightmares

Note: Dan - Shift from entirely co-located, to partly remote PM, to ad-hoc remoteness
We've had some difficult experiences when we've injected randomness into our locations. We were ill prepared for this.



## Dopamine
