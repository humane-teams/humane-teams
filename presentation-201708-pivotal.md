"I had begun to notice that the more *humanely* I treated myself and others, the more *productive* we all became"

Kent Beck, XP Explained



## Humane
### (Productive & Effective)
* Kindness & Respect
* Safe to be wrong
* Authentic conversations
* Meeting people’s needs



## Inhumane
### (Unproductive & Ineffective)
* Too busy to improve
* When you "pick your battles"
* Heroics
* Practices without Values



## Death Spiral

Note:
Dan - point out link between 5 Dysfunctions of a Team & Project Aristotle



## We broke the team
* Shifting from collocated → dispersed
* Part-time members
* Communicating presence
* (Remote) pairing
* Supporting new hires
* AV/meeting room nightmares

Note: Dan - Shift from entirely co-located, to partly remote PM, to ad-hoc remoteness
We've had some difficult experiences when we've injected randomness into our locations. We were ill prepared for this.



## Team member lifecycle

### Joining → Working → Leaving



## Prepare for the schedule you are planning to work

Note: Hardware, Logistics, Routine



## Make work achievable

## If it works, write it down
Then read/review it regularly

Note:
Dan - story about how introspective git repo has helped.

Emma - explain why it's great that distributed teams write things down.



## Work from shared values



## XP Values
